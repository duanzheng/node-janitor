## üöÄ Overview

Node Janitor is a cross-platform desktop application built with Electron that helps developers reclaim disk space by efficiently managing Node.js project dependencies and package manager caches. Whether you're dealing with hundreds of `node_modules` folders or bloated package caches, Node Janitor makes cleanup simple and safe.

## ‚ú® Features

### üóÇÔ∏è **Project Cleaner**

- **Smart Scanning**: Recursively scan directories to find all Node.js projects
- **Bulk Operations**: Select and delete multiple `node_modules` folders at once
- **Space Calculation**: See exactly how much disk space you'll reclaim
- **Safe Deletion**: Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental deletions
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates during cleanup operations

### üóÉÔ∏è **Cache Manager**

- **Multi-Manager Support**: Detect and clean caches from npm, yarn, and pnpm
- **Cache Statistics**: View cache sizes and locations before cleaning
- **Selective Cleaning**: Choose which package managers to clean
- **Instant Results**: See freed space immediately after cleanup

### üõ°Ô∏è **Built for Safety**

- **Secure Architecture**: Uses Electron's security best practices
- **User Confirmation**: All destructive operations require explicit approval
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Async Operations**: Non-blocking UI during intensive file operations

- **Disk**: 500 MB free space

### Build from Source

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js (>= 16.0.0)
- Yarn package manager

```bash

yarn make
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

### Project Cleaner

1. **Select Directory**: Choose the root directory to scan for Node.js projects
2. **Scan Projects**: Click "Scan" to find all projects with `node_modules` folders
3. **Review Results**: See the list of found projects and their sizes
4. **Clean Up**: Select projects and click "Clean Selected" to remove `node_modules`

### Cache Manager

1. **Detect Caches**: The app automatically detects package manager caches
2. **View Sizes**: See how much space each cache is using
3. **Clean Caches**: Select which caches to clean and confirm the operation
4. **Verify Results**: Check the freed space summary

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Ant Design 5.x
- **Backend**: Electron + Node.js
- **Build Tools**: Webpack + Electron Forge
- **Testing**: Jest + ts-jest
- **Package Manager**: Yarn

### Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server
yarn dev

# Run tests
yarn test

# Run tests with coverage
yarn test:coverage

# Build the app
yarn build

# Package the app
yarn package

# Create distributable packages
yarn make
```

### Testing

- **Test Environment**: Node.js with Jest
- **Mocking**: Electron, fs-extra, and execa are mocked for unit testing
- **Coverage**: Configured to exclude renderer, preload, and main entry files

## üöÄ Release Process

This project uses automated releases via GitHub Actions:

### Automated Releases
- **Trigger**: Push a version tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`) to trigger automated builds
- **Cross-Platform**: Automatically builds for macOS, Windows, and Linux
- **Distribution**: Creates installers and packages for all platforms
- **GitHub Release**: Automatically publishes to GitHub Releases with generated notes

### Creating a New Release
```bash
# Update version in package.json
npm version patch  # or minor/major

# Create and push tag
git push origin main --tags
```

The GitHub Actions workflow will:
1. ‚úÖ Run tests on all platforms
2. üèóÔ∏è Build applications for macOS, Windows, and Linux  
3. üì¶ Create platform-specific installers
4. üöÄ Publish to GitHub Releases automatically
