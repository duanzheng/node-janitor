## üöÄ Overview

Node Janitor is a cross-platform desktop application built with Electron that helps developers reclaim disk space by efficiently managing Node.js project dependencies and package manager caches. Whether you're dealing with hundreds of `node_modules` folders or bloated package caches, Node Janitor makes cleanup simple and safe.

## ‚ú® Features

### üóÇÔ∏è **Project Cleaner**

- **Smart Scanning**: Recursively scan directories to find all Node.js projects
- **Bulk Operations**: Select and delete multiple `node_modules` folders at once
- **Space Calculation**: See exactly how much disk space you'll reclaim
- **Safe Deletion**: Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental deletions
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates during cleanup operations

### üóÉÔ∏è **Cache Manager**

- **Multi-Manager Support**: Detect and clean caches from npm, yarn, and pnpm
- **Cache Statistics**: View cache sizes and locations before cleaning
- **Selective Cleaning**: Choose which package managers to clean
- **Instant Results**: See freed space immediately after cleanup

### üõ°Ô∏è **Built for Safety**

- **Secure Architecture**: Uses Electron's security best practices
- **User Confirmation**: All destructive operations require explicit approval
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Async Operations**: Non-blocking UI during intensive file operations
